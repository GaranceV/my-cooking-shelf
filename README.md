# My cooking shelf

This is a web project to store and get my recipes, in a way I like, for myself.

## Technologies
This projects uses ES6 code, both for the client and server sides.
The data is stored in a mongodb database, on mlab.
I am relying on mocha and chai for tests.
I am using gulp, to automate as many processes as I can.
There is no build command yet, though, this is for a later phase of the project.
